# Tuple is often used if you have a couple of values that aren't going to change but you need to store
# a pair of values like two values together,or three values together, or something like it.

#  whereas in lists we use square brackets to denote
# where the list begins and where the list ends, in a tuple,

coordinateX = 10.0
coordinateY = 20.0
coordinate = (10.0, 20.0)


# tuple, on the other hand, is a sequence of immutable values
# Set , collections of unique values.(with no sequence and every value appear once)
# dictionary. In Python, shortened to just a dict, whichis the collection of what we're going to call key-value pairs.
